The classList.toggle method allows me to assign the new class to all elements without a class in the body of the document upon the function call which is triggered by the click of the button. The function also changes the text on the button on each click, checking the current state of the button's content and using .textContent to replace them."

The objects from the JSON file were injected into each respective element for name and content before being appeneded to the postElement and then the blogList."
